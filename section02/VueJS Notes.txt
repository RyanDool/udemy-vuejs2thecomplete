VueJS Notes


Section 2 Lecture 12-13
You can NOT use curly braces in ANY html attributes. 
CURLY BRACES CAN ONLY BE USED WHERE TEXT IS PLACED
For html attributes use v-bind e.q.
<a v-bind:href="link">{{ linkText }}</a>
That data being bound are stored in the VueJs instance 


Section 2 Lecture 14
If you wish to use the first iteration of data that later changes in the instance use
v-once, this will use the intial value.


Section 2 Lecture 15
VueJs ESCAPES html elements, to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. so you cannot pass html through as a data value. 
Instead use a directive!
v-html
<p v-html="htmlLink"></p>
NOTE: use v-html carefully, if it is passing data from a user interaction it opens up the possibility of cross-site attacks.


Section 2 Lecture 16
Use directive v-on to allow user interaction for instance something happens onClick 
<button v-on:click="someFunction">Click This Button</button>
